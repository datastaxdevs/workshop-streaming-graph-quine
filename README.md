# 🎓 Graph Streaming with Astra and Quine

Welcome to the *Graph Streaming and Quine** workshop! In this two-hour workshop, we show how to combine scalable database as `Apache Cassandra™` with a poweful realtime graph engine `Quine`.

Using **Astra DB**, the cloud based _Cassandra-as-a-Service_ platform delivered by DataStax, we will cover the very first steps for every developer who wants to try to learn a new database: creating tables and CRUD operations.

## 1. Objectives

1️⃣ **Give you an understanding and how and where to position Apache Cassandra™**

2️⃣ **Give an overview of the NoSQL ecosystem and its rationale**

3️⃣ **Provide an overview of Cassandra Architecture**

4️⃣ **Make you create your first tables and run your first statements**

🚀 **Have fun with an interactive session**

## 2. Frequently asked questions

<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 1️⃣ Can I run this workshop on my computer?</b></summary>
<hr>
<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine. If you do so, you will need the following:
<ol>
<li><b>git</b> installed on your local system
</ol>
</p>
In this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>we can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.
</details>
<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 2️⃣ What other prerequisites are required?</b></summary>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>You will need enough *real estate* on screen, we will ask you to open a few windows and it would not fit on mobiles (tablets should be OK)
<li>You will need an Astra account: don't worry, we'll work through that in the following
<li>As "Intermediate level" we expect you to know what java and Spring are. 
</ul>
</p>
</details>
<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 3️⃣ Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?</b></summary>
<hr>
<b>No.</b> All tools and services we provide here are FREE. FREE not only during the session but also after.
</details>
<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 4️⃣ Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?</b></summary>
<hr>
Attending the session is not enough. You need to complete the homework detailed below and you will get a nice badge that you can share on linkedin or anywhere else *(open badge specification)*

# 🏁 Start Hands-on

## 4. Create your Astra DB instance

_**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, 40M read/write operations and about 80GB storage monthly for free - sufficient to run small production workloads. If you end your credits the databases will pause, no charge_

Leveraging [Database creation guide](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/#c-procedure) create a database. *Right-Click the button* with *Open in a new TAB.*

<a href="https://astra.dev/2-16"><img src="images/create_astra_db_button.png?raw=true" /></a>

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Database Name**| `workshops`|
|**Keyspace Name**| `quine`|
|**Regions**| Select `GOOGLE CLOUD`, then an Area close to you, then a region with no LOCKER 🔒 icons, those are the region you can use for free.   |

> **ℹ️ Note:** If you already have a database `workshops`, simply add a keyspace `quine` using the `Add Keyspace` button on the bottom right hand corner of db dashboard page.

While the database is being created, you will also get a **Security token**:
save it somewhere safe, as it will be needed to later in others workshop (In particular the string starting with `AstraCS:...`.)

The status will change from `Pending` to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

## 8. What's NEXT ?

We've just scratched the surface of what you can do using Astra DB, built on Apache Cassandra.
Go take a look at [DataStax for Developers](https://www.datastax.com/dev) to see what else is possible.
There's plenty to dig into!

Congratulations: you made to the end of today's workshop.

**... and see you at our next workshop!**
